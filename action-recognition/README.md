# VIPriors Action Recognition Challenge

*Maintainer: Marcos Baptista RÃ­os (mbaptista@gradiant.org)*

Welcome to the VIPriors Action Recognition Challenge. This challenge is part of the "[2nd Visual Inductive Priors for Data-Efficient Deep Learning Workshop](https://vipriors.github.io/)", which will be held at [ICCV 2021](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/home). The winner of the challenge is invited to present their work during the workshop.

The common idea of all VIPriors challenges is to have models trained from scratch on an reduced version of a certain dataset for a certain Computer Vision task. In this particular challenge, the task is Action Recognition and the original dataset is Kinetics400.

## Data

We provide a modification of the Kinetics400 dataset with train, validation and test subsets. Please:

- **Do not use the original distribution of the Kinetics400 dataset.** 
- **DO NOT PRETRAIN your models ON ANY DATASET.** 
- **TRAIN your model FROM SCRATCH.** 

Please, find more information on how to get the modified dataset as well as the annotations in the data README.

## Evaluation

The task will be evaluated using the mean average accuracy over all classes on the test set. The winner of the challenge will be determined with the highest Top-1 accuracy. However, as extra information of the models, we will also compute the Top-3 and Top-5 accuracy.

For more information about the evaluation, please refer to the evaluation toolkit README.

## Baselines

We provide some baselines trained and tested on the train and validation sets, respectively, of the challenge version of dataset.

For more information about the baselines that we offer, please refer to the baselines README.

## Additional information

All the tooling provided for this challenge was tested using a common python 3.7 installation. The only needed packages are numpy, pandas and and scikit-learn. You can find the models in the `requirements.txt `file. Although it should work with different versions, we recommend to use the same which we tested with.
