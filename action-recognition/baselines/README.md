# VIPriors Action Recognition Challenge - Baselines

We provide different baselines as a starting point for participants to compare their codes to. The results of all the baselines are for the validation set of the Kinetics400ViPriors dataset.

All baselines are generated following the restrictions and conditions of the challenge. Please, make sure to also follow the rules. 

## Baselines

The baselines we offer are *(more will be released soon)*:

- **Random chance baseline.** It's a baseline that simply assigns random labels to clips. The script to generate the results of this baseline can be found in the `chance/` folder, inside this directory. You can check the result file of this baseline as guide to create yours.

## Performance

We show, in the table below, the performance of the baselines on the validation set

| Baseline | Top-1 Accuracy (%) | Top-3 Accuracy (%) | Top-5 Accuracy (%) |
| :------: | :----------------: | :----------------: | :----------------: |
|  chance  |       0.241        |       0.631        |       1.072        |
